Working with the programs, is not the main issue. Currently the biggest issue i have is, ensuring that they all work together. Which relies on my comprehension of the programs. 

This will be the first real trial of mine in the course. Start to finish. My goal will be to try and keep things organized and readable. Followed by a working project by the time it is finished. 

I will update as often as i allow myself to remember. 

My main goal with this project is to better harmonize my understanding of these programs, and how i can efficently navigate them. 

These skills are, the command line, creating and moving my files that i work on strictly through command strokes. Repeatedly laying the framework and setting up a website and each of its pages. Ensuring that all work along with GitHub in the end. And finally applying style with the additional knowledge gained through the lesson.

Additionally... understanding the best way for me to add commits and regualarily do them. My biggest issue wont be applying what ive learned. But not forgetting one of the many cooperating skills.
